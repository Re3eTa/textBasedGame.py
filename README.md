# textBasedGame.py
trying to make a text based game using boolean paths to create a unique story, instead of using multi choice conditional chains.
the way I explained it to my mum was to visualise the story would look like:
[[1a,1b,1c](first part of the story) [2aa,2ab,2ac,2ba,2bb,2bc,2ca,2cb,2cc](second part of the story) and so on...
